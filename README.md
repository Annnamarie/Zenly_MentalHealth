**Inspiration**

There has been a rise in mental health awareness in the past couple of years and the market has responded with a boom in mental health application that focuses on one or two niches. Our app will be a one stop mental health app that consolidates all the different niches such as meditation, mood trackers, and journal logs.

**What it does**

Zenly app will ask the user how their day has been going and will allow you to log your mood. Either happy, neutral, sad, or angry and the user will be able to see an weekly and monthly overview letting them know how their mental health has been. The app also guides you through techniques to de-stress such as meditation guides and meditation tracker. User is also able to enter journal logs.

**How we built it**

Our project is focused on the UI/UX and utilized Figma to create the different features and pages.

**Challenges we ran into**

We are a group of beginners on our first hackathon. Learning and navigating through new design tools as well new frameworks. Our project mainly focuses on the design but we also tried to incorporate backend and produce an app, hence, learning another framework and language of React Native and JavaScript.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**

We were able to translate our ideas into a viable app that will manage, and track the user's mental health in their day-to-day lives. We were also able to create the basic homepage of a mobile app.

**What we learned**

Learned how to navigate through Figma and really dive into the complex features. We also learned a new framework React Native even through this was not our focus.

**What's next for Zenly**

We will be looking to implement the design into an actual working mobile app.

**Built With**

Figma, Prototype, React Native
